# DataFile
Create a program that writes the following text to a text file: This is one line in the file. Make the program write this text to a file once, and add the same text to the existing text another time as a new line of text below. Explanation: PrintWriter is a Java class that allows us to write to a file. It receives the file name through the constructor. Using the println method, we print a new line to the file. The close () method must always be put at the end in order to save and save what you typed. FileWriter in this part of the task allows us to add text to existing content in the file.
